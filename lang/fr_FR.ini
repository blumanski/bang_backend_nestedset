; If you need to pass variables into a string.
; The parameters can get scanned usung the php function vprintf
; See below how to add this

; %b - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as a binary number.
; %c - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as the character with that ASCII value.
; %d - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as a (signed) decimal number.
; %e - the argument is treated as scientific notation (e.g. 1.2e+2). The precision specifier stands for the number of digits after the decimal point since PHP 5.2.1. In earlier versions, it was taken as number of significant digits (one less).
; %E - like %e but uses uppercase letter (e.g. 1.2E+2).
; %f - the argument is treated as a float, and presented as a floating-point number (locale aware).
; %F - the argument is treated as a float, and presented as a floating-point number (non-locale aware). Available since PHP 4.3.10 and PHP 5.0.3.
; %g - shorter of %e and %f.
; %G - shorter of %E and %f.
; %o - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as an octal number.
; %s - the argument is treated as and presented as a string.
; %u - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as an unsigned decimal number.
; %x - the argument is treated as an integer and presented as a hexadecimal number (with lowercase letters).
; %X - the argument is treated as an integer and presented as a hexadecimal number (with uppercase letters).
